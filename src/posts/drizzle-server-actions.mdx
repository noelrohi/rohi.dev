[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) is now my favorite ORM. I tried using it way before they introduced relational queries, I thought it's good but now it is even better and it keeps getting better. With their release in [0.28.2](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/releases/tag/0.28.3), it is so simple to create typesafe mutations with inferring insert of a model.

[Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions) is still experimental in Nextjs 13 but is now in [React](https://react.dev/) Canary. This let you call async function inside client components without exposing any secrets in network tab nor using an api route in the same codebase.

In this example, I'll be using shadcn-ui to create form component, as followed in the [docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form).

After modifying `onSubmit` function a bit, the code looks like this ...

```tsx
// /commponents/create-form.tsx
"use client";

import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import { useTransition } from "react";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

import { createPost } from "@/actions/post";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/form";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import z from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(3),
});

type Inputs = z.infer<typeof schema>;

export function CreatePost() {
  const [isCreating, startCreating] = useTransition();
  const form = useForm<Inputs>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
    defaultValues: {
      name: "",
    },
  });

  function onSubmit(postData: Inputs) {
    startCreating(async () => {
      const response = await createPost(postData);
      console.log(response);
      form.reset();
    });
  }

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form
        onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}
        className="relative max-w-sm space-y-4"
      >
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name="name"
          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Post text</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Input placeholder={"Good morning"} {...field} />
              </FormControl>
              <FormMessage />
            </FormItem>
          )}
        />
        <div className="flex justify-end">
          <Button type="submit" disabled={isCreating}>
            {isCreating ? "Creating" : "Submit"}
          </Button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

This already includes accessibility and client & server validations. Notice that we're importing a `createPost` action which is the server action.

```ts
// /actions/post.ts
"use server";

import { db } from "@/server/db";
import { posts } from "@/server/db/schema";
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";

export async function createPost(data: typeof posts.$inferInsert) {
  try {
    await db.insert(posts).values(data);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof Error) {
      return { status: "error", message: error.message };
    }
    return { status: "error", message: "Something went wrong!" };
  }
  return { status: "ok", message: "Successfully created!" };
  revalidatePath("/");
}
```

In the server action function, it takes a parameter of the expected object value of a post to be inserted so I just need to pass it as an argument of values. Code looks cleaner this way right?

That's pretty much it. Thank you for stopping by!
